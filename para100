the bbc is also renowned for its production of costume dramas , such as jane austen 's pride and prejudice and contemporary social dramas such as boys from the blackstuff and our friends in the north . the bbc has come under pressure to commission more programmes from independent british production companies , and indeed is legally required to source 25 % of its output from such companies by the terms of the broadcasting act 1990 . programmes have also been imported mainly from english-speaking countries : notable—though no longer shown—examples include the simpsons from the united states and neighbours from australia . because of the availability of programmes in english , few programmes need use sub-titles or dubbing unlike much european television .

while the " footprint " of the astra 2d satellite was smaller than that of astra 2a , from which it was previously broadcast encrypted , it meant that viewers with appropriate equipment were able to receive bbc channels " free-to-air " over much of western europe . consequently , some rights concerns have needed to be resolved with programme providers such as hollywood studios and sporting organisations , which have expressed concern about the unencrypted signal leaking out . this led to some broadcasts being made unavailable on the sky digital platform , such as scottish premier league and scottish cup football , while on other platforms such broadcasts were not disrupted . later , when rights contracts were renewed , this problem was resolved .

gustav had a preference for his elder son , meinhard ( july 17 , 1946 – may 20 , 1971 ) , over arnold . his favoritism was " strong and blatant , " which stemmed from unfounded suspicion that arnold was not his biological child . schwarzenegger has said his father had " no patience for listening or understanding your problems . " schwarzenegger had a good relationship with his mother and kept in touch with her until her death . in later life , schwarzenegger commissioned the simon wiesenthal center to research his father 's wartime record , which came up with no evidence of gustav 's being involved in atrocities , despite gustav 's membership in the nazi party and sa . schwarzenegger 's father 's background received wide press attention during the 2003 california recall campaign . at school , schwarzenegger was apparently in the middle but stood out for his " cheerful , good-humored and exuberant " character . money was a problem in their household ; schwarzenegger recalled that one of the highlights of his youth was when the family bought a refrigerator .

" in 1961 , schwarzenegger met former mr. austria kurt marnul , who invited him to train at the gym in graz . he was so dedicated as a youngster that he broke into the local gym on weekends , when it was usually closed , so that he could train .
